# Super Math Saga Repo

This repo is for the queries associated with the A/B Test for Super Math Saga.

We set the assignment process to randomly distribute players among the groups: 80 to group A (control) and 20% to group B (test).
The experiment ran from '2017-05-04' to '2017-05-22'.

## **Folders:**
  - Explore: These are queries that were helpful in exploring the data and for sanity checks.
  - Sample: This is how we created our sample groups, the playerid's can be found in the smsaga_activity CTE's.

## **Resources:**
Tools used for this analysis were Big Query, Excel, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Tableau, and Git.
